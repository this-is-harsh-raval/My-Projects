**PID Controller: A Brief Overview**

**What is a PID Controller?**

A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is a control loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial control systems and other applications requiring continuously modulated control. It calculates an error value as the difference between a measured process variable and a desired setpoint and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms.  

**How Does a PID Controller Work?**

**Proportional (P) term:** Produces an output signal proportional to the current error.

**Integral (I) term**: Accumulates the error over time and produces an output signal based on the accumulated error. This helps to eliminate steady-state error.

**Derivative (D) term:** Produces an output signal based on the rate of change of the error. This helps to anticipate future errors and improve system response.
